 # FEATURES I USED FROM PROJECT REQUIREMENTS 
 
 1. Read in data from a csv file.
 2. Use built-in pandas or numpy
    functions to do things like
    remove null values.
 3. Did basic calculations with
    Pandas, like finding the
    max(), median(), mean(), or
    min() and length of a column. 
 4. Made 2 basic plots with
    matplotlib.
 5. Wrote markdown cells in
    Jupyter explaining my
    thought process and code.
    Using markdown, I explained what the
    reader is seeing and why I
    chose to plot things the way I did.
